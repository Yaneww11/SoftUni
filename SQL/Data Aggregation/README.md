Gringotts Database Management
Mr. Bodrog is a small and greedy goblin who serves as the supervisor of Gringotts, the biggest bank in the wizarding community. His most prized possession is a database that contains information about deposits made in the wizarding world, and his pastime is to extort money from others. Despite his eagerness to obtain your money, you do not possess any magical abilities. Instead, you have expertise in database management, which allows you to access this valuable data.

Mr. Bodrog insists that you provide him with daily reports, threatening to send a pack of starving werewolves after you if you fail to comply. To avoid these dangerous creatures, it is recommended to create a database named gringotts_db and open its query tool. Download the `04-Exercises-Data-A
